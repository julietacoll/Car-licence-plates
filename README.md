The results show:
* that 2021 and 2022 were the only years in which registration of imported cars was lower than registration of domestic cars
* that there is no particular month in which domestic cars are registered more than imported cars
* the top 5 years with the most amount of matriculations and we can see that in those years the amount of imported cars registered was higher than domestic cars
* From 2019 we can see the breakdown by categories of registered cars
